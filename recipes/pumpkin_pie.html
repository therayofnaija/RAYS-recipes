        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>750g/1lb 10oz pumpkin or butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and cut into chunks</uL>
        <ul>350g sweet </ul>
        <ul>Plain flour, for dusting</ul>
        <ul>140g Caster sugar</ul>
        <ul>1/2 table spoon salt</ul>
        <ul>1/2 table spoon fresh nutmeg, grated</ul>
        <ul>1 table spoon cinnamon</ul>
        <ul>2 eggs, beaten</ul>
        <ul>25g butter, melted</ul>
        <ul>175ml milk</ul>
        <ul>1 table spoon icing sugar</ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>Place the pumpkin in a large saucepan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Cover with a lid and simmer for 15 mins or until tender. Drain pumpkin; let cool.</ol>
        <ol>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and use it to line a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Chill for 15 mins. Line the pastry with baking parchment and baking beans, then bake for 15 mins. Remove the beans and paper, and cook for a further 10 mins until the base is pale golden and biscuity. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.</ol>
        <ol>Increase oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Push the cooled pumpkin through a sieve into a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, salt, nutmeg and half the cinnamon. Mix in the beaten eggs, melted butter and milk, then add to the pumpkin pur√©e and stir to combine. Pour into the tart shell and cook for 10 mins, then reduce the temperature to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Continue to bake for 35-40 mins until the filling has just set.
        </ol>
        <ol>Leave to cool, then remove the pie from the tin. Mix the remaining cinnamon with the icing sugar and dust over the pie. Serve chilled.</ol>
